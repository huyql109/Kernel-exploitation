some notes when solving this challenge:
_ userfaultfd is pain :(, careful with the `len`. uffdio_copy.len should equal with the len in uffd register ???
_ careful with race condition, it can run even the qemu script dont add more cores or threads to qemu
_ careful with ropchain, avoid push, it will make our rop crash
_ trick with tty_struct:
    _ overwrite tty_struct->ops->flush_buffer with gadget (push rdi, pop rsp)
    _ call close() to trigger 
    _ luckily, rdi stores the pointer of tty_struct
    _ now rsp points to tty_struct, in tty_struct put gadget `pop rsp` and a abr address => we can jump to our lpe rop chain
