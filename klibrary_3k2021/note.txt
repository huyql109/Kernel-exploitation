_ use this command to deal when musl-gcc cant find kernel headers
```
gcc -E $1 -o exploit_temp.c
musl-gcc -o exploit exploit_temp.c -static -s -lpthread
```

_ pthread_join() after race??

_ sometimes the exploit just can't access to an address but it doesnt throw error??

_ calling "/dev/ptmx" create 2 tty_struct objects??

_ overwrite task_struct is awesome :v
