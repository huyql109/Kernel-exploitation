_ init_cred is a global cred struct => stored in kernel 
_ after overwrite real_cred and cred with fake craft cred_init, avoid using c functions that related to current task??

vul:
_ add_note doesnt stop when null -> buffer overflow
_ show_note uses strcpy => lead to leak (doesnt make any sense here)
